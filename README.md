This project is creating a multi-page site for looking up the odds for the Florida Lottery.

Starting off with the Pick 2 Florida Lottery, downloaded the entire results into a database and looking to write code in javascript to show
the Hot/cold numbers, Top rankings of the numbers by certain a range of drawings, Show results of Odds/Evens by a certain range of drawings,
and then of course show all the results since 2016.

First step was creating a random 2 number generator, which is the index page.

This specific lottery is drawn twice a day "Mid-day and Evening".

Next step right now is coding the javascript for the rankings of the numbers. Also figuring out a way to pull the current drawing date and
numbers from the Florida Lottery website.  Then of course, adding that current info to the results database.  Looking to make these pages 
pull the info on their own each day.

It's a big challenge for a first project but I have to start somewhere :)

Once I get this completed, I am looking to expand to all of the Florida Lotteries.
